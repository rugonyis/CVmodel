# CVmodel
This project will allow the user to upload a 3D biomedical imaging and semi-automatically delineate from that image a cardiovascular structure of interest, such as the heart or blood vessels. Then, a computational model based on the geometry will be generated. The user will be able to interactively assign properties and boundary conditions to the model. Simulation of the model will result in quantifications of 3D blood flow velocities and pressure within the geometry. The user will be able to visualize and extract data from simulated results, depicting the dynamics of blood flow within the cardiovascular structure.
